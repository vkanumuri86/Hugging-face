Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
This project is a comprehensive Python notebook exploring various data visualization techniques using two of the most popular libraries in the Python ecosystem: Matplotlib and Seaborn. It demonstrates how to create static, informative, and complex visualizations with minimal code.

🚀 Features
Matplotlib Integration: Learn how to use this foundational library for creating a wide range of static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

Seaborn High-Level Interface: Explore complex data relationships with ease using Seaborn's high-level API.

Statistical Graphics: Implementation of advanced plots like pair plots to visualize multidimensional relationships within datasets (e.g., the tips dataset).

🛠️ Installation
To run this notebook, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

Bash
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
📊 Visualizations Included
The notebook covers several visualization types, including but not limited to:

Relational Plots: Understanding dependencies between variables.

Categorical Plots: Visualizing data across different categories.

Pair Plots: Using sns.pairplot() to show all pairwise relationships in a dataset and the univariate distribution of each variable.

💻 Usage
Clone this repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
Navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter Notebook:

Bash
jupyter notebook Data_visualization.ipynb
Run the cells to see the code in action and view the generated plots.

📚 Libraries Overview
